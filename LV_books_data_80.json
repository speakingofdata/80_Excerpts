{"id":"15167","title":"American Vendetta: A Story of Barbarism in the United States","description":"The phrase \"The Hatfields and McCoys\" conjures up images of feudal warfare and Appalachian backwardness even to this day. This is a sensationalized account of the feud between the Hatfields and McCoys along the mountainous border of Kentucky and West Virginia in the late 1800s. At the height of the feud in 1888, yellow journalist T. C. Crawford interviewed Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield in person at his headquarters in West Virginia. Crawford's stories were serialized in a New York newspaper and later published in book form.<br><br>The accounts of the Hatfields and McCoys led to the still-common, unfair stereotype of the ignorant, backward, trigger-happy mountaineer. While the violence in the Wild West was romanticized, the violence in the Appalachians was vilified and exaggerated. The resulting sentiment was that the mountain folk needed civilizing, which the railroad and coal mining capitalists were eager to provide . . . in exchange for their land, autonomy, and generally happy way of life.

He died in 424 B. C.\n<br><\/br>\nThe subject of the history of Herodotus is the struggle between the Greeks and the barbarians, which he brings down to the battle of Mycale in 479 B. C. The work, as we have it, is divided into nine books, named after the nine Muses, but this division is probably due to the Alexandrine grammarians. His information he gathered mainly from oral sources, as he traveled through Asia Minor, down into Egypt, round the Black Sea, and into various parts of Greece and the neighboring countries. The chronological narrative halts from time to time to give opportunity for descriptions of the country, the people, and their customs and previous history; and the political account is constantly varied by rare tales and wonders.\n<br><\/br>\nAmong these descriptions of countries the most fascinating to the modern, as it was to the ancient, reader is his account of the marvels of the land of Egypt.

We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.\"\nSo wrote author Charles MacKay in this landmark work, which is still in print in the twenty-first century, and is considered most important for its analysis of economic \"bubbles,\" such as the dot com bubble of 1997-2001. To a lesser degree, it was one of the first serious attempts to examine crowd psychology and is still a touchstone in that field. The history of the twentieth century suggests that as the planet has become more populated, the workings of crowd psychology have increasingly influenced everyday life, sustaining the longevity of MacKay's observations.\nIn this volume are eight topics, four of which MacKay would classify as \"Peculiar Follies:\" the Crusades, the Witch Mania, the outbreak of assassination by slow poisoning, and a belief in haunted houses. The other four: Popular Admiration for Great Thieves, Popular Follies in Great Cities, Duels & Ordeals, and Relics, he classified as national delusions.\n(DrPGould)<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/memoirs-of-extraordinary-popular-delusions-and-the-madness-of-crowds-volume-i-by-charles-mackay\/\">Link to Volume 1<\/a>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24518","language":"English","copyright_year":"1852","num_sections":"35","url_rss":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/12723","url_zip_file":"https:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/populardelusion_vol2_1805_librivox\/populardelusion_vol2_1805_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds","url_librivox":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/extraordinary-popular-delusions-vol-2-by-charles-mackay\/","url_other":"","totaltime":"14:37:25","totaltimesecs":52645,"authors":[{"id":"4709","first_name":" Charles","last_name":"Mackay","dob":"1814","dod":"1889"}]},

An American born and bred, I early noted, as everyone else in like case must note, certain salient differences between the English of England and the English of America as practically spoken and written\u2014differences in vocabulary, in syntax, in the shades and habits of idiom, and even, coming to the common speech, in grammar. And I noted too, of course, partly during visits to England but more largely by a somewhat wide and intimate intercourse with English people in the United States, the obvious differences between English and American pronunciation and intonation.\n Greatly interested in these differences\u2014some of them so great that they led me to seek exchanges of light with Englishmen\u2014I looked for some work that would describe and account for them with a show of completeness, and perhaps depict the process of their origin.

{"id":"8433","title":"Vagabonding Down The Andes","description":"Sometime in the latter half of 1911, Harry A. Franck jumped out of a box-car and crossed the Rio Grande, from Laredo. Thus began a journey, often afoot, that Harry estimated would take him 8 months. It ended up occupying four years of his life. The first leg of his Latin American epic is recorded in \"Tramping Through Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras; Being the Random Notes of an Incurable Vagabond\" (The Century Company, 1916). He then headed south to the Canal Zone, Teddy Roosevelt's grand experiment in socialism, and applied within the Zone police force for a position as a census taker (chronicled in \"Zone Policeman 88; A Close Range Study of the Panama Canal and Its Workers\", The Century Company, April 1913). Since he was one of the few Americans who actually spoke Spanish, and a bevy of other languages, he was hired immediately. By June, 1912, he'd bankrolled enough money to see him through the opening phase of the work I'll be reading for you, \"Vagabonding Down the Andes; Being the Narrative of a Journey, Chiefly Afoot, From Panama to Buenos Aires\" (The Century Company, 1917). Leaving the Zone in June of 1912, with \"objections to his reemployment\", he caught a steamer and entered the South American continent at Cartagena, Colombia. Approximate 30 months later, having walked most of the length of the Inca highway, he staggered from a trek that took him over mountains and through raw jungle onto a ferry, and thence sailed into Buenos Aires, regarded as one of the most glamorous and expensive cities on earth at the time. This leg of the four volume epic (which later concludes with \"Working North from Patagonia; Being the Narrative of a Journey, Earned on the Way, Through Southern and Eastern South America, The Century Company, 1921) was the longest one, and in many respects, \"Vagabonding Down the Andes\" was also the most detailed. As you can see, the works were not published in chronological order. Why? I don't know, other than the last volume, which was delayed by Harry's enlistment and serving in WWI.\n\nHarry is an opinionated iconoclast with a strong American value system based upon self-reliance. He's both college-educated and what I suppose can best be called \"street smart\", though most of his trip took him through places where \"street\" was little more than an abstract concept. Before his South American journey, he'd already worked his way around the world, and had written a book about it (\"A Vagabond Journey Around the World\", The Century Company, 1910). Some people are going to get their Politically Correct dander up if they listen. Well, fast traveler, keep in mind that Harry was a man of his times, and thus he sees the world, as we are all people of our times, and thus we see and experience the world. Harry did his vagabonding with a pistol as his constant companion, and lived amongst the poorest classes of people. He drank water collected in the ruts of wagon wheels. Not knowing where his next meal was coming from was the norm, as opposed to the exception. In terms of travel writing he makes Paul Theroux look like an armchair dilettante. Take him as he is, and I think you'll soon become enmeshed in this extraordinary saga.\n\nWritten by Elliott Swanson, reader.","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/vagabondingdowna00franuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"41","url_rss":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8433","url_zip_file":"https:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/vagabonding_down_andes_1711_librivox\/vagabonding_down_andes_1711_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/vagabonding-down-the-andes-by-harry-a-franck\/","url_other":"","totaltime":"32:43:47","totaltimesecs":117827,"authors":[{"id":"10249","first_name":"Harry A.","last_name":"Franck","dob":"1881","dod":"1962"}]},
